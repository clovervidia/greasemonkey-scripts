A collection of Greasemonkey scripts I've written to improve web pages

## The Scripts

`YouTube Link Redirect Fixer.user.js` is the only script as of right now. Its job is simple: Remove the YouTube redirected links in YouTube video descriptions and comments and replace them with the original link. It also replaces the truncated URLs with the full URL to make copy-pasting them easier.
